A list of all smart contract exploits successfully carried out on the smart contract security hackathon at [Damn Vulnerabe Defi](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/)

<br/>

## [Naive Receiver](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/challenges/2.html)

_Task Description:_

There's a lending pool offering quite expensive flash loans of Ether, which has 1000 ETH in balance.

You also see that a user has deployed a contract with 10 ETH in balance, capable of interacting with the lending pool and receiveing flash loans of ETH.

Drain all ETH funds from the user's contract. Doing it in a single transaction is a big plus ;)

<br/>

## [Side Entrance Lender Pool](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/challenges/4.html)

_Task Description:_

A surprisingly simple lending pool allows anyone to deposit ETH, and withdraw it at any point in time.

This very simple lending pool has 1000 ETH in balance already, and is offering free flash loans using the deposited ETH to promote their system.

You must take all ETH from the lending pool.

<br/>

## [The Rewarder](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/challenges/5.html)

_Task Description:_

There's a pool offering rewards in tokens every 5 days for those who deposit their DVT tokens into it.

Alice, Bob, Charlie and David have already deposited some DVT tokens, and have won their rewards!

You don't have any DVT tokens. But in the upcoming round, you must claim most rewards for yourself.

Oh, by the way, rumours say a new pool has just landed on mainnet. Isn't it offering DVT tokens in flash loans?

<br/>

## [Truster](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/challenges/3.html)

_Task Description:_

More and more lending pools are offering flash loans. In this case, a new pool has launched that is offering flash loans of DVT tokens for free.

Currently the pool has 1 million DVT tokens in balance. And you have nothing.

But don't worry, you might be able to take them all from the pool. In a single transaction.

<br/>

## [Unstoppable](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/challenges/1.html)

_Task Description:_

There's a lending pool with a million DVT tokens in balance, offering flash loans for free.

If only there was a way to attack and stop the pool from offering flash loans ...

You start with 100 DVT tokens in balance.
